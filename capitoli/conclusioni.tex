\section{The potential of Scala for Pulumi}
Scala's functional paradigm is matching very well the declarative approach of Pulumi.
Therefore, the higher order functions, the currying, and the monad for the \texttt{Output} type, along with the modern features offered by the Scala language such as the \texttt{using} and \texttt{given} keywords, has let us create an expressive, concise, and readable syntactic sugar for our Scala Pulumi APIs.\\
Pulumi offers good challenges for the programming languages when it comes to declare resources that depends on other resources.
Scala is able to keep up with these challenges, in fact its design features are letting us work perfectly with Pulumi without having to resort to ad-hoc functions created to compensate other languages' shortcoming, such as the \texttt{pulumi.all} function.\\
In my opinion, a further extension of the work done for the support of Scala in Pulumi would be a great addition to the currently supported languages.
If possible, a official support of Scala for Pulumi would be much appreciated from the community.
